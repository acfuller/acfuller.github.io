Project Plan: Bug-B-Gon

1. Introduction

This document lays out a project plan for the development of “BugBGon” open source repository system by Adam Fuller.
The intended readers of this document are current and future developers working on “BugBGon” and future employers of the developer. The plan will include, but is not restricted to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective of the “BugBGon” team (me), scheduling and delivery estimates, project risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which I will develop the project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project. (Paragraph mostly stolen from geeksforgeeks.org)

2. Overview

Are you a programmer? Do you always write perfect code? Of course you do! But most of us don’t and trying to fix bugs in our code by eye is nigh impossible. In order to help to eliminate some eye strain from searching for all those bugs I am providing a bug tracker that will be able to tell you what the bug in your code is doing and where it originated from.

2.1 Customers

Any persons who can at least write a “Hello World!” statement.

2.2 Functionality

Users should be able to create login accounts.
Logged in users can upload projects.
Users will be able to look at metrics about bugs in the uploaded projects.
Projects will have an overview area that allows comments and editing.
Site will have different privileges for different users i.e. admin, manager, user, viewer.

2.3 Platform

It will be launched as a Web-based application.

2.4 Development Responsibility
I, Adam Fuller, would be developing the software and I am responsible for the creation of the database and all the other related stuff.

3. Goals and Scopes

My goal is to get a fully functioning bug tracker to use of my and any other programmers projects.
The initial scope will allow a maximum of 700 people to have an account at once.

4. Deliverables (maybe)

Feature specification
Product design
Test plan
Development document
Source code
End product

5. Technical Process

Following would be the languages I would use to develop my application within the stipulated time period:
Front-end development: Jquery, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
Back-end development: .NET, MySQL.
